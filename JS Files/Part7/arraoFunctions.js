//   this functions declaration has no functin kewword ,   and nameless function and can be used to store the value in a variable and or passed to higher order function as a param  called callback function  ..
 
// when there is only one param we can take off those  paranthesis   but when there are no parameters or arguments paranthesis is compulsory 

// So when theree is no logic , and there is no logss   but only single  operation ,,,, return keyword is not necessary 
// no curly braces  its paranthesis 

const mul = (a,b) => ( a*b );
console.log(mul(1,2));

const cube =  n => n*n*n;
console.log(cube(3));
