friends tell me to ask  ceo as he knows you 
but i think as relative ?  I remembered  you saying we are family .. but y ?

my brothercannot work as he is having health issue  , i am the only one who should bring my family up ..

I came here for learnings which i cant do in MNC's   there i will have perks but no learning , even If i get jobs in other companyy in future i will learn a lot from her e.

When you sai we are like family  inwant to increase revenue and take mkney only fromnthen 
Yupp tv  romance mobies may increase I thought atbthat time as people are so addicted to porn and etc 
So basic school

I will consider all theese tome waste .

Money ðŸ’°  sowmya husband government job . 
Brother earns crores amazon us 
Brother in law phani around 50 lacs through yupp . 

Eshwar dad finance 
10 crores by SIP . 

you said we are family when i received your regarding my brothers admission in MGIt . i just thought of 50K extra ppayment ahead of fee reembrisment . 
i had to think because my father's earning is less so i also secured free seat there .
So i started saving things.  As you asked ece for my brother 30K savings .
But dont spend money on others . Carefull . 
But my dad has no such plans  spends money carelessly and no money with us right now . 


But i just want to know why you considered us as family.  
Dad's behaviour is different with others and us . 
If he cares us. No conflicts and no fights.  But thats not happening.  He doesn't tell a single thing and share a single with us .
Just 

Dad good morining

people do hardwork doesnot earn 
Ithought only IIT earns more 
but people with different ideality who puts their smartness in business etc eans more than them 
youtube etc are the sources . 

I am still using tablets which costs 50K

corporate  if we doesnot know anything we can managa

People take me granted for being nice .
Thay like the people who do crazy stupid vibe bad words things,  thay enjoy that . Being nice in this world is a sin .


stocks ? 
amazon badminton gut 
servicenow 40lacs stoks 

Data analytics from hemanth pavan
Java etc from phani 
Backend from scope team .etc

I always aim at high 

people will manage things like abhishek  etc sowmya phani  is excellent  
even if they dont work they will tell they have done a lot of work  .

but i cannot do that because i cannot tell lies 
i should know everything . 

I always choose money free 
Free college as we are already in debt but so chose mgit rather than private 
And chose company rather than loan for masters .
I didn't take your company as granted. P

Last option meere
