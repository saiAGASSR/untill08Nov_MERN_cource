express router is used for simplification of readability of code . 
express router is not mandatory to use .
but it should  be used for creating  better websites  . 

restructuring the app.js file into small parts 

express.router() method returns an object which is stored in router 
const router = express.router();



similar routes  which starts with same /users  /posts 


const app = express();
app.get 

const router = express.router();

router.get 
does the same 

router is an object 
so we are exporting the object 

importing the router object in app.js
then settting the config 


app.use("/",users)

here users is the imported object or file 

refactoring 

app.use("/users",users);
